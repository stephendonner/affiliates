        Firefox Affiliate buttons are a bit of HTML code that you put
        on your website or blog to encourage visitors to your site to
        download Firefox. When a visitor to your site clicks on a
        button on your site and downloads Firefox, you get credit for
        that download.

        Affiliates who get a lot of downloads through their site will
        be featured on our leaderboard and be elegible for fun stuff
        like Firefox T-shirts. While we do send out prizes and gifts
        to our affiliates from time to time, Firefox Affiliates does
        not offer monetary rewards for hosting Firefox buttons.
